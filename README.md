# get_next_line
The get_next_line project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor with a specified bytes amount for read(), given as a `-D BUFFER_SIZE` compile option. Work
has to be done according to [subject](./en.subject.v10.pdf) and
[norm](https://github.com/42School/norminette) requirements.

## Goals:
- getting experience with static variables usage in C;
- getting file line by line reading tool which can be useful in future School
projects (standard C library usage will be forbidden);
